/*
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels,
and S representing the stones you have.
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
